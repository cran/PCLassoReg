Description: Two protein complex-based group regression models (PCLasso and PCLasso2) for risk protein complex identification. PCLasso is a prognostic model that identifies risk protein complexes associated with survival. PCLasso2 is a classification model that identifies risk protein complexes associated with classes. For more information, see Wang and Liu (2021) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbab212>.
